                <h1>Sumith Shantraj</h1>
                <h2>Biography</h2>

                <p>Photography found me at a time when I was searching for a way to express what words couldn't capture. What began as a fascination with light and shadow has evolved into a lifelong passion for telling stories through images that matter. My relationship with photography started during my college days in Bengaluru, when I borrowed a friend's camera to document a local cultural festival. That first click—capturing the pure joy on a dancer's face—changed everything.</p>

                <p>I believe that every photograph should tell a story—not just document an event, but capture the essence of a moment. Whether I'm photographing a CEO's portrait or a wedding celebration, I'm always looking for that authentic connection, that genuine expression that reveals character. My approach is rooted in patience and observation, where professionalism meets authenticity and technical skill serves emotional truth.</p>

                <p>Over the years, I've had the privilege of working with incredible clients across Bengaluru and beyond. Each project has taught me something new about human nature, about light, about storytelling. I've learned that the best photographs emerge from genuine collaboration—when I understand not just what my clients need, but why it matters to them.</p>

                <h2>Creative Director</h2>

                <p>As Creative Director at Lens Sculpture, I bring a unique perspective to visual storytelling that blends technical precision with artistic vision. My journey in photography has been driven by a passion for creating images that not only capture moments but evoke emotions and tell compelling stories.</p>

                <p>Throughout my career, I've had the privilege of working on diverse projects spanning corporate photography, event coverage, fashion editorials, product showcases, and travel documentation. Each project presents an opportunity to push creative boundaries while maintaining the highest standards of professional excellence. I believe that great photography is born from collaboration, attention to detail, and an unwavering commitment to the client's vision.</p>

                <p>My approach combines strategic thinking with creative execution. Whether directing a complex commercial shoot or capturing candid moments at an event, I focus on understanding the narrative we're trying to tell and the impact we want to create. The images you see throughout Lens Sculpture represent years of dedication to this craft and countless hours of bringing visions to life through the lens.</p>
